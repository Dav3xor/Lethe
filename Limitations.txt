Known limitations or discrepancies between platforms:

1. Linux events, semaphores, and mutexes don't support automatic reset
 - This has been fixed by use of a loadable kernel module (libCommon/module) which must be installed to use Mutexes, Semaphores, and Auto-Reset Events in Linux (otherwise their constructors will throw an exception)
 - A kernel patch for this probably will not happen due to complications with epoll_ctl(ADD)
   - When adding an fd to an epoll set, a poll will be done
   - This will do a read on the event/semaphore/mutex without notifying the user
   - In addition, poll/epoll will do a read even if POLLIN is not a selected event

2. LinuxTimers do not support automatic reset
 - If the eventfd change goes over well, consider implementing the same thing for timerfd

3. No method in Linux to wait for all file descriptors in a set before returning
 - No plan on implementing this at the moment, seems too easy to deadlock in Linux
 - Because of this, waitAll is not implemented for windows, either
