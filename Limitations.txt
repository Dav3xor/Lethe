Known limitations or discrepancies between platforms:

1. A loadable kernel module has been made to add auto-reset capability to Linux events, semaphores, mutexes, and timers
 - see LetheCommon/module/eventfd-lethe.c and timerfd-lethe.c
 - based off of existing eventfd and timerfd subsystems written by Davide Libenzi
 - A kernel patch for this probably will not happen due to complications with epoll_ctl(ADD)
   - When adding an fd to an epoll set, a poll will be done
   - This will do a read on the event/semaphore/mutex without notifying the user
   - In addition, poll/epoll will do a read even if POLLIN is not a selected event

2. No method in Linux to wait for all file descriptors in a set before returning
 - No plan on implementing this at the moment, seems too easy to deadlock in Linux
 - Because of this, waitAll is not implemented for windows, either

3. No method for causing an error on wait for Windows events, semaphores, mutexes, or timers
