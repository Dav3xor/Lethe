Limitations between platforms:

The items in the list are preventing certain features from being enabled, in that one platform supports the feature, but another plaform doesn't

1. Linux events don't support automatic reset
 - If fixed: add a boolean to the Event constructor to enable automatic reset on a successful wait
 
2. Linux mutexes don't support automatic locking on a wait
 - If fixed: add a getHandle function to Mutex objects
 
3. No method in Linux to wait for all file descriptors in a set before returning
 - If fixed: implement waitAll function in LinuxHandleSet
 
4. WindowsTimers are cleared by setting the timer again to a very long timeout
 - If fixed: No real impact, just kind of stupid
