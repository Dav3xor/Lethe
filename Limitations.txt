Known limitations or discrepancies between platforms:

1. Linux events, semaphores, and mutexes don't support automatic reset
 - This has been fixed by use of a loadable kernel module (libCommon/module) which must be installed to use Mutexes, Semaphores, and Auto-Reset Events in Linux (otherwise their constructors will throw an exception)
 - Working on testing and submitting a kernel patch to add this functionality to the base kernel

2. LinuxTimers do not support automatic reset
 - If the eventfd change goes over well, consider implementing the same thing for timerfd

3. No method in Linux to wait for all file descriptors in a set before returning
 - No plan on implementing this at the moment, seems too easy to deadlock in Linux, and this can be left up to the user if they want something equivalent
 - This also means that waitAll should be disabled on Windows
