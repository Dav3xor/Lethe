Fixes (see limitations):
  eventfd linux kernel patch - probably not going to happen, investigate fixing for epoll_ctl(ADD)
  timerfd linux kernel patch
  Windows WaitForMultiple is limited to 64 handles, add limit to WaitSets
  Pipe destruction - what to do with pending writes - don't want to block, but what if an async write is only partially done
  MessageStream/ByteStream behavior when receive is called with nothing to receive - exception or NULL/0 return - should be consistent
  Windows LetheCommonTest/waitSet/abandoned not implemented - figure out how to force abandoned wait result
