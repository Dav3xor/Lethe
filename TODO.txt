Features:
  Common:
    Investigate replacing ostream-style Log interface with fastformat::write
    implement errored synchronization objects in windows (if it's even possible)
  SocketComm:
    ByteStream
    MessageStream
  ThreadUtil:
    CommRegistry: socket streams

Tests:
  Common:
    finish mutex tests
    test error behavior
  ThreadComm:
    ByteStream test
    More comprehensive MessageStream tests
  ProcessComm:
    all tests
  SocketComm:
    all tests
  ThreadUtil:
    all tests

Fixes (see limitations):
  MessageStream/ByteStream behavior when receive is called with nothing to receive - exception or NULL/0 return - should be consistent
  Linux LetheCommonTest/waitSet/abandoned not implemented - figure out how to force abandoned wait result
  Pipe needs a way to specify whether construction should fail if the files already exist (or attempt to remove the files)
