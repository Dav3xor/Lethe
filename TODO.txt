Features:
  libCommon:
    Enforce limits on semaphore value
    Add LinuxWaitSet::waitAll implementation
    Investigate replacing ostream-style Log interface with fastformat::write

Fixes (see limitations):
  eventfd linux kernel patch
  timerfd linux kernel patch
  LinuxSemaphore initial value is slightly broken?  Acts like one less than it should be
