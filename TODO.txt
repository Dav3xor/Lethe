Features:
  libCommon:
    Enforce limits on semaphore value
    Add LinuxWaitSet::waitAll implementation
    Investigate replacing ostream-style Log interface with fastformat::write

Fixes (see limitations):
  eventfd linux kernel patch
  timerfd linux kernel patch
  LinuxSemaphore initial value is slightly broken?  Acts like one less than it should be
  Windows WaitForMultiple is limited to 64 handles, add limit to WaitSets
  It appears that an autoreset file descriptor added to a wait set after being set does not trigger correctly during a wait
