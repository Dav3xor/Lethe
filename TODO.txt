Features:
  libCommon:
    Enforce limits on semaphore value
    Investigate replacing ostream-style Log interface with fastformat::write

Fixes (see limitations):
  eventfd linux kernel patch
  timerfd linux kernel patch
  Windows WaitForMultiple is limited to 64 handles, add limit to WaitSets
  Adding a file descriptor to an epoll_wait set causes a poll to be done on the fd.  This is causing problems with autoreset.  Fix: use poll instead of epoll?
