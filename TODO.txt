Fixes (see limitations):
  Windows WaitForMultiple is limited to 64 handles, add limit to WaitSets
  MessageStream/ByteStream behavior when receive is called with nothing to receive - exception or NULL/0 return - should be consistent
  Windows LetheCommonTest/waitSet/abandoned not implemented - figure out how to force abandoned wait result
  Pipe needs a way to specify whether construction should fail if the files already exist (or attempt to remove the files)
