Features:
  libCommon:
    Add thread restart() function to allow a closed thread to begin again
    Enforce limits on semaphore value
    Allow mutexes to accumulate locks when relocked by the same thread
    Add LinuxWaitSet::waitAll implementation
    Investigate replacing ostream-style Log interface with fastformat::write

Fixes (see limitations):
  eventfd linux kernel patch
  timerfd linux kernel patch
  pipe asynchronous write
  There appears to be a bug in the Thread class that destroying a thread that is currently running sometimes results in a 'pure virtual call' - this was observed using a timeout of 0 and no WaitObjects in the derived thread
